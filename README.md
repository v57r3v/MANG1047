The table below gives the dates when each assignment will become available and when they will be due in:Assignment number    Weeks covered    Release date    Due date    1    1-3 18/10/2024   24/10/2024    2    4-5    01/11/2024    07/11/2024    3    6-7    15/11/2024    21/11/2024    4    8-9    29/11/2024    05/12/2024    5    10-11    13/12/2024    09/01/2025 
Each assignment will be released on Blackboard and you will submit your solutions via Blackboard. Unlike the practice quizzes you will only be able to submit one attempt for each of the assignments Blackboard quizzes (you can save your progress while you are working on it).
Your workings must be submitted as well as your quiz answers (unless indicated otherwise in the question workings should be included for all questions). The essay questions in the same quiz on Blackboard should be used for your workings (which may be quite short for some questions). You are encouraged to take photos of handwritten workings and insert them into the answer space.
If you use methods not covered in this module then you must give a reference indicating where you have learnt the alternative method.
Submission:
1. You should submit your answers in the quiz format on Blackboard. 
   2. You should also submit your workings in the sam代 写MANG1047 Management Analysis SEMESTER 1 2024/25Matlab
代做程序编程语言e quiz format on Blackboard.
   a. You need to insert or upload photos of handwritten workings rather than typing them.
   b. If you have used software to assist you in answering a question this should be included in your workings, eg. give the formula used in Excel. 
   c. Include references, using the Harvard referencing style, for any methods not covered in the module.
Both the online solutions and upload of workings for each part of the coursework must be completed before the deadline - if either is submitted late the latest submission will count for calculation of lateness. Any lateness penalties will be applied to the mark of the part that was submitted late before the overall marks are calculated.
As we will be releasing solutions with the marks, extensions will not be possible.
Grading:
Each assignment will be marked out of 30. Your overall grade for the assignment will be the average of your best 4 marks, out of the 5 parts of the coursework. This means that your lowest mark will not count.
Any late penalties will be applied to the individual parts before the overall grade is calculated.Nature of Assessment: This is a SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT. See ‘Weighting’ section above for the percentage that this assignment counts towards your final module mark.References: You should use the Harvard style. to reference your assignment. The library provide guidance on how to reference in the Harvard style. and this is available from: http://library.soton.ac.uk/sash/referencing   Submission Deadline: Please note that the submission deadline for Southampton Business School is 16.00 for ALL assessments.Turnitin Submission:   The assignment MUST be submitted electronically via Turnitin, which is accessed via the individual module on Blackboard. Further guidance on submitting assignments is available on the Blackboard support pages. 
It is important that you allow enough time prior to the submission deadline to ensure your submission is processed on time as all   late submissions are subject to a late penalty.    We would recommend you allow 30 minutes to upload your work and check the submission has been processed and is correct. Please make sure you submit to the correct assignment link.
Email submission receipts are not currently supported with Turnitin Feedback Studio LTI integrations, however following a submission, students are presented with a banner within their assignment dashboard that provides a link to download a submission receipt. You can also access your assignment dashboard at any time to download a copy of the submission receipt using the receipt icon. It is vital that you make a note of your Submission ID (Digital Receipt Number). This is a unique receipt number for your submission, and is proof of successful submission. You may be required to provide this number at a later date.    We recommend that you take a screenshot of this page, or note the number down on a piece of paper.
